# Chill Contributor Guidelines (v1.0)

This project is just some code on the internet that people sometimes poke at for fun or usefulness.

We don't have a lot of rules because we assume you're already a mostly functional adult (or a very advanced bot).

### The Extremely Short Version
- Don't be a dick.
- Code talks, bullshit walks.
- If someone's being annoying enough that it stops being fun for others, the maintainers might ask them to chill or take a timeout.

### Slightly Longer (But Still Chill) Version

**Expected behavior (the bare minimum):**
- Talk about code, ideas, bugs, features, memes—whatever.
- Disagree? Cool. Explain why without calling someone an idiot.
- PRs get reviewed on technical merit + whether they make the project better overall.
- Newbies get patience (we were all clueless once).

**Things that will probably get you a polite "nah" or a banhammer:**
- Personal attacks instead of technical criticism.
- Spamming, derailing threads into politics/religion/flamewars for no reason.
- Harassing people (publicly or in DMs/side channels).
- Being relentlessly negative or obstructive in a way that poisons the vibe for everyone else.

No giant list of banned words, no mandatory pronoun declarations, no sensitivity training required.  
Just use common sense: if most people in the room would roll their eyes at your comment in real life, maybe rephrase it.

### Enforcement? Sort of.
Maintainers are volunteers, not hall monitors.  
If something crosses into "this is actively making the project worse" territory, we'll handle it case-by-case—usually with a warning first, then mute/lock/remove/ban if needed.  
No appeals court, no three-strike system, no bureaucracy. Just trying to keep the place nice enough that people want to keep contributing.

If you're wondering "is this okay?", the golden question is usually:  
"Would I say/do this to a coworker whose help I actually want?"

If the answer is no → maybe reword it.  
If the answer is yes → send it.

That's it.  
Have fun, ship things, be excellent to each other (Bill & Ted voice).
